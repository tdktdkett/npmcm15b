%FITGMDIST Fit a Gaussian mixture distribution to data.
%   GM = FITGMDIST(X,K) fits a Gaussian mixture distribution with K
%   components to the data in X.  X is an N-by-D matrix.  Rows of X
%   correspond to observations; columns correspond to variables. FITGMDIST
%   fits the model by maximum likelihood, using the
%   Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
%
%   FITGMDIST treats NaNs as missing data.  Rows of X with NaNs are
%   excluded from the fit.
%
%   GM = FITGMDIST(X,K, 'PARAM1',val1, 'PARAM2',val2, ...) allows you to
%   specify optional parameter name/value pairs to specify details of the
%   model and to control the iterative EM algorithm used to fit the model.
%   Parameters are:
%
%      'Start'       The method used to choose initial mean, covariance, and
%                    mixing proportion parameters for the Gaussian components.
%                    Specify the value for 'Start' as one of the following:
%
%                    * 'randSample', to select K observations from X at random
%                      as the initial component means.  The initial mixing
%                      proportions are uniform, and the initial covariance
%                      matrices for all components are diagonal, where the Jth
%                      element on the diagonal is the variance of X(:,J).  This
%                      is the default.
%
%                    * As a vector of length N containing component indices,
%                      chosen from 1:K, for each observation in X.  The initial
%                      values for the mean and covariance of each component are
%                      the sample mean and covariance of the observations
%                      assigned to that component, and the initial values for
%                      the mixing proportions are the proportion of each
%                      component in the specified indices.
%
%                    * As a scalar structure S containing the initial parameter
%                      values in the following fields:
%
%                        S.mu: A K-by-D matrix specifying the initial mean of
%                           each component.
%
%                        S.Sigma: An array specifying the covariance matrix of
%                           each component.  Sigma is one of the following:
%                           * A D-by-D-by-K array.  SIGMA(:,:,J) is the initial
%                             covariance matrix of component J.
%                           * A 1-by-D-by-K array.  DIAG(SIGMA(:,:,J)) is the initial
%                             covariance matrix of component J.
%                           * A D-by-D matrix SIGMA is the initial covariance
%                             matrix for all components.
%                           * A 1-by-D vector.  Diag(SIGMA) is the initial
%                             covariance matrix for all components.
%
%                        S.PComponents: A 1-by-K vector specifying the initial
%                           mixing proportions of each component.  The default
%                           is uniform.
%
%      'Replicates'  A positive integer giving the number of times to repeat the
%                    fit, each with a new set of initial parameters.  GMFIT is
%                    the fit with the largest likelihood.  The default number
%                    of replicates is 1.  A value larger than 1 requires the
%                    'randSample' start method.
%
%      'CovType'     'diagonal' if the covariance matrices are restricted to be
%                    diagonal; 'full' otherwise.  The default is 'full'
%
%      'SharedCov'   True if all the covariance matrices are restricted to be
%                    the same (pooled estimate); false otherwise.  The default
%                    is false.
%
%      'Regularize'  A non-negative regularization value to be added to the
%                    diagonal of each covariance matrix to ensure that the
%                    estimates are positive-definite.  The default is 0.
%
%
%      'Options'     Options structure for the iterative EM algorithm, as
%                    created by STATSET.  The following STATSET parameters
%                    are used:
%
%                      'Display'  Level of display output.  Choices are
%                                 'off' (the default), 'iter', and 'final'.
%                      'MaxIter'  Maximum number of iterations allowed.
%                                 Default is 100.
%                      'TolFun'   Positive number giving the termination
%                                 tolerance for the log-likelihood
%                                 function.  The default is 1e-6.
%
%   Example:   Generate data from a mixture of two bivariate Gaussian
%              distributions and fit a Gaussian mixture model:
%                 mu1 = [1 2];
%                 Sigma1 = [2 0; 0 .5];
%                 mu2 = [-3 -5];
%                 Sigma2 = [1 0; 0 1];
%                 X = [mvnrnd(mu1,Sigma1,1000);mvnrnd(mu2,Sigma2,1000)];
%                 gmfit = fitgmdist(X,2);
