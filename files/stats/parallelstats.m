%PARALLELSTATS Parallel computation in the Statistics Toolbox
%  Several commands in the Statistics Toolbox can make use of multiple
%  processors to run computations in parallel. If you request parallel
%  computation, a Statistics Toolbox function will perform iterative
%  calculations in parallel if you have a license for the Parallel
%  Computing Toolbox (PCT) and you have a MATLAB pool open. Parallel
%  computation incurs extra overhead, compared to serial computation, but
%  it can speed up costly iterative calculations.
%
%  You can use three optional parameters to control Statistics Toolbox
%  functions that support parallel computation. You supply the parameters
%  as fields of a struct, which you may construct using the STATSET
%  function. If you are new to parallel computation in MATLAB, you may 
%  wish to consult the Glossary of Terms at the end of this text, prior
%  to reading the parameter descriptions. The parameter names and a
%  description of their values are:
%
%  'UseParallel'     Indicates whether eligible functions should use
%                    capabilities of the Parallel Computing Toolbox (PCT),
%                    if the capabilities are available -- that is, if the
%                    PCT is installed and a license is available. Valid
%                    values are FALSE (the default), to indicate that you
%                    want serial computation, and TRUE, to choose
%                    parallel computation.
%
%                    It is valid to set 'UseParallel' to TRUE, even if
%                    if the PCT is not available.  In this case, the 
%                    Statistics Toolbox command will run in serial mode 
%                    on the client. This behavior allows "parallelized" 
%                    code to be portable, and it facilitates more convenient
%                    debugging.  However, when debugging you should take 
%                    into account that iterations may be performed in 
%                    different order when in parallel mode than they would
%                    with 'UseParallel' equal to FALSE.
%
%  'UseSubstreams'   Many parallelized toolbox commands generate random
%                    numbers as part of their calculations.  This parameter
%                    indicates whether the command should use a separate
%                    substream of the random number generator for each
%                    iteration in loops that are parallelized.  By doing
%                    so, the command generates results in such a way that
%                    you can reproduce them, either in serial or parallel.
%                    See below for further discussion and examples. Valid
%                    values are TRUE, or do use a separate substream
%                    for each iteration, or FALSE, do not use a separate
%                    substream for each iteration. The value TRUE can
%                    only be used with random stream types that support
%                    substreams. Defaults to FALSE.
%
%  'Streams'         A random number stream (i.e., an object of the
%                    RandStream class), or a cell array of streams. If no
%                    value is supplied for this parameter, the default
%                    random stream on each MATLAB session will be used to
%                    generate random numbers. Otherwise 'Streams' supplies
%                    the stream or streams to be used by the MATLAB
%                    sessions involved in the computation.
%
%                    The rules governing the 'Streams' parameter depend on
%                    the 'UseSubstreams' parameter. If 'UseSubstreams' has
%                    the value TRUE, then 'Streams' must be a single
%                    random number stream, or a scalar cell array
%                    containing a single stream.
%
%                    If 'UseSubstreams' is FALSE, and the computation is
%                    in serial mode, then 'Streams' must be a single random
%                    number stream, or a scalar cell array containing a
%                    single stream.
%
%                    If 'UseSubstreams' is FALSE, and the computation is
%                    in parallel, then the number of random streams
%                    supplied by 'Streams' varies from function to function
%                    in the Statistics Toolbox. There are two basic
%                    patterns. Some functions only generate random numbers
%                    on the client, even though multiple parallel workers
%                    are used elsewhere during the calculations. For these
%                    commands, 'Streams' must supply a single stream. Other
%                    functions generate random numbers on every parallel
%                    worker involved in the parallel computations.  For
%                    these functions, 'Streams' must have the same length
%                    as the size of the parallel pool. Consult each
%                    parallelized Statistics Toolbox function for its
%                    particular requirements. 
%
%                    When 'UseParallel' is true, even if a parallel pool
%                    is not open, then depending on your installation 
%                    and preferences, the PCT may open a parallel pool
%                    for you.  For any Statistics Toolbox function
%                    that requires 'Streams' to have the same length
%                    as the size of the parallel pool, it is best to
%                    open a pool explicitly, using the GCP or PARPOOL
%                    command, before calling the function with
%                    'UseParallel' equal to TRUE.  See Example 3 
%                    below, Case (C), for further explanation.
%
%  RANDOM STREAMS IN PARALLEL
%
%  When you open a pool of MATLAB workers, each worker creates its own
%  default random number stream. The default streams are initialized in
%  such a way that you can treat all the different streams as being
%  statistically independent. Thus, the result of a computation is
%  statistically equivalent to the same computation performed in serial
%  mode.  Serial and parallel computations may generate different random 
%  values, but both will produce equally valid results. You do not need 
%  to make any special initialization of the parallel workers' default 
%  random number streams in order to use one of the Statistics Toolbox 
%  functions that supports parallel computation.
%
%  Instead of using the parallel workers' default random number streams,
%  you can use the 'Streams' parameter to supply your own streams to
%  Statistics Toolbox functions that support parallel computation. The
%  streams you supply are used within that function call, and they do not
%  replace the workers' default streams.
%
%  Note that whenever you modify the workers' default random number
%  streams, or replace them for a calculation, you must take care that the
%  changes you make do not invalidate the statistical independence of the
%  streams in the MATLAB pool. A safe and convenient way to create random
%  streams that work correctly in a MATLAB pool is to use one of the MATLAB
%  random stream types that support multiple streams. See the section on
%  "Multiple streams" in the MATLAB User Guide.
%
%  SUBSTREAMS AND REPRODUCIBILITY
%  
%  Most often, you want computations that use random numbers to exhibit
%  "ongoing" randomness. That is, you expect the results to continue to
%  vary randomly if you repeat the calculation. However, in some cases it
%  is important to be able to reproduce the same result over and over, by
%  recreating a previous set of initial conditions, and then generating
%  exactly the same results during a repeat of the computation.  For
%  Statistics Toolbox functions that support parallel computation, this
%  kind of reproducibility requires that you use the 'UseSubstreams'
%  parameter. When operating in parallel mode, iterative calculations may
%  be assigned to workers in an unpredictable fashion, and iterations may 
%  occur in an unpredictable order. Therefore, simply putting the workers' 
%  random streams in a known state before calling a Statistics Toolbox 
%  function does not guarantee predictable results. If 'UseSubstreams' is 
%  TRUE, the Statistics Toolbox function associates each loop iteration 
%  with a precalculated substream index, or starting point in the random 
%  stream being used. Therefore it does not matter which worker performs 
%  the iteration, or whether the computation is in serial or parallel mode.

%  serial computation     Computation performed on a single MATLAB session.
%                         This is also called "serial mode".
%  parallel computation   Computation that takes place using all the MATLAB
%                         Sessions in a parallel pool. Also called "parallel

%  client                 The primary MATLAB session, which gives you the
%                         command window. You always interact with the
%                         client. When there is a parallel pool open, the
%                         client interacts on your behalf with the workers
%                         in the parallel pool. The client is also the MATLAB
%                         session that performs serial mode computation.
%  worker                 A MATLAB session in a parallel pool. The worker
%                         does not have a graphical display and does not

%
%  EXAMPLES:
%
%  EXAMPLE 1
%
%  The following example demonstrates parallel computation with default
%  random number streams. This is the simplest and probably the most common
%  type of use of parallelized Statistics Toolbox functions. The "parallel"
%  form of TreeBagger works whether you are licensed for PCT or not. If you
%  have a parallel pool open (this requires the PCT), TreeBagger will build
%  fifty decision trees using multiple processors in parallel. If you do
%  not have a parallel pool open, MATLAB may try to open a pool for 
%  you (depending on your preferences and whether you have the PCT).  
%  If MATLAB succeeds in opening a parallel pool, TreeBagger will again
%  build the trees using parallel computation.  Otherwise, the computations
%  will run in serial mode.
%  
%    load fisheriris
%    opt = statset('UseParallel',true);
%    b = TreeBagger(50, meas, species, 'oobpred','on', 'opt',opt);
%    plot(oobError(b))
%    xlabel('number of grown trees')
%    ylabel('out-of-bag classification error')
%
%  EXAMPLE 2
%
%  This example demonstrates how to use the 'UseSubstreams' parameter to
%  generate results that you can replicate on a subsequent function call,
%  either in serial or parallel mode. Note that you can run this example
%  only if you have a license for PCT, otherwise the "gcp" command is
%  invalid.
%
%    % We will start with an open MATLAB pool.
%    try
%        p = gcp();
%        if isempty(p)
%            nWorkers = 0;
%        else
%            nWorkers = p.NumWorkers;
%        end
%    catch ME
%        nWorkers = 0;
%    end
% 
%    % If nWorkers == 0, MATLAB could not open a parallel pool.
%    % You need to determine why before proceeding with the example.
%
%    % You must use a random number stream that supports substreams
%    stream = RandStream('mrg32k3a');
%    optpar = statset('UseParallel',true, ...
%                     'UseSubstreams',true, ...
%                     'Streams',stream);
%
%    % Run bootstrp() in parallel mode with the 'UseSubstreams' parameter
%    y = exprnd(5,100,1);
%    bootstatPar = bootstrp(100, @mean, y, 'options', optpar);
%
%    % Set the random number stream to the state it had before you ran the
%    % parallel bootstrp.
%    reset(stream)
%
%    % Now run the same bootstrp command, again in parallel
%    bootstatPar2 = bootstrp(100, @mean, y, 'options', optpar);
%
%    % The results should be identical
%    isequal(bootstatPar, bootstatPar2)
%
%    % Reset the stream again 
%    reset(stream)
%
%    % Rerun the bootstrp() command, this time in serial mode. To do so,
%    % you can create a serial-mode Options parameter, as below. This will
%    % tell the bootstrp command to run in serial mode on the client, even
%    % though a parallel pool remains open (you also get serial computation
%    % if you simply do not specify 'UseParallel', since 'false' is the
%    % default value).
%
%    optser = statset('UseParallel',false, ...
%                     'UseSubstreams',true, ...
%                     'Streams',stream);
%    bootstatSer = bootstrp(100, @mean, y, 'options', optser);
%
%    % Again the results should be identical
%    isequal(bootstatPar, bootstatSer)
%
%  EXAMPLE 3
%
%  This example demonstrates use of the 'Streams' parameter when your goal is
%  basic randomness, not reproducibility. The example can only be run if you
%  have the PCT installed and licensed. The example will cover three cases:
%  (A) A MATLAB pool is open, and the Statistics Toolbox function uses
%  random numbers on the workers.
%  (B) A MATLAB pool is open, and the Statistics Toolbox function uses
%  random numbers on the client (though it uses the workers for other parts
%  of the computation).
%  (C) The Statistics Toolbox function would use random numbers on the workers
%  if there were a MATLAB pool open, but a MATLAB pool is not currently
%  open.
%
%    % CASE (A)
%    %
%    % TreeBagger generates random numbers on all of the workers. 
%    % If you are supplying your own streams, you must supply one for each 
%    % worker in the MATLAB pool.
%
%    % We will start with an open MATLAB pool
%    try
%        p = gcp();
%        if isempty(p)
%            nWorkers = 0;
%        else
%            nWorkers = p.NumWorkers;
%        end
%    catch ME
%        nWorkers = 0;
%    end
% 
%    % If nWorkers == 0, MATLAB could not open a parallel pool.
%    % You need to determine why before proceeding with the example.
%
%    poolsz = nWorkers;
%    streams = RandStream.create('mlfg6331_64', ...
%                                'NumStreams', poolsz, ...
%                                'StreamIndices', 1:poolsz, ...
%                                'CellOutput', true);
%    optMany = statset('UseParallel',true,'Streams',streams);
%    load fisheriris
%    b = TreeBagger(50, meas, species, 'oobpred','on', 'options',optMany);
%    plot(oobError(b))
%    xlabel('number of grown trees')
%    ylabel('out-of-bag classification error')
%
%    % Case (B) 
%    %
%    % The crossval function only uses random numbers on the client. 
%    % Therefore it only recognizes a single stream, even if there is 
%    % an open parallel pool.
%
%    % We will start with an open MATLAB pool
%    try
%        p = gcp();
%        if isempty(p)
%            nWorkers = 0;
%        else
%            nWorkers = p.NumWorkers;
%        end
%    catch ME
%        nWorkers = 0;
%    end
% 
%    % If nWorkers == 0, MATLAB could not open a parallel pool.
%    % You need to determine why before proceeding with the example.
%
%    soloStream = RandStream('mlfg6331_64');
%    optSolo = statset('UseParallel',true, 'Streams',soloStream);
%    load('fisheriris');
%    y = meas(:,1);
%    X = [ones(size(y,1),1),meas(:,2:4)];
%    regf=@(XTRAIN,ytrain,XTEST)(XTEST*regress(ytrain,XTRAIN));
%    cvMse = crossval('mse', X, y, 'predfun',regf, 'options',optSolo); 
%
%    % Case (C)
%    %
%    % Repeat case (A) but without first opening a parallel a pool. 
%
%    % Make sure there is no pool open.
%    p = gcp('nocreate');
%    delete(p)
%
%    % Depending on your preferences and whether you have PCT available 
%    % when 'UseParallel' is true, MATLAB may try to open a parallel pool.
%    % If it succeeds, then the value of 'Streams' must match the number 
%    % of workers in the pool that was created.  Say that you know that 
%    % your default parallel pool size is 4.  Then you can issue:
%    poolsz = 4;
%    streams = RandStream.create('mlfg6331_64', ...
%                                'NumStreams', poolsz, ...
%                                'StreamIndices', 1:poolsz, ...
%                                'CellOutput', true);
%    optMany = statset('UseParallel',true,'Streams',streams);
%    load fisheriris
%    b = TreeBagger(50, meas, species, 'oobpred','on', 'options',optMany);
%
%    % The above statement will succeed if a pool was opened with number
%    % of workers equal to your expected size.  Otherwise it will fail.
%
%    % If a pool failed to open, then there is only one MATLAB session 
%    % available (the client).  Thus TreeBagger expects only a single
%    % stream, regardless of the value of 'UseParallel'.  In that case,
%    % the following command sequence would work:
%
%    soloStream = RandStream('mlfg6331_64');
%    optSolo = statset('UseParallel',true, 'Streams',soloStream);
%    b2 = TreeBagger(50, meas, species, 'oobpred','on', 'options',optSolo);
%
%    % Because it is difficult to ensure the outcome of the auto-opening
%    % of the parallel pool, it is best to use the GCP or PARPOOL command
%    % and explicitly create a parallel pool prior to using parallelized
%    % Statistics Toolbox commands with 'UseParallel' set to TRUE.
%    
%  See also statset, statget, parfor, parpool, gcp, RandStream, RandStream/Substream.
