%SMARTFORREDUCE Adaptive dispatch of for-loops or parfor-loops.
%
%   SMARTFORREDUCE provides dispatching of for-loops or parfor-loops on behalf of 
%   Statistics Toolbox commands that support both serial and parallel 
%   modes of computation.
%
%   VARARGOUT = ...
%       SMARTFORREDUCE(NITER,LOOPBODY,USEPARALLEL,RNGSCHEME,REDUCTIONVARIABLES)
%   identifies reduction variables and specifies how they are to be calculated.
%   REDUCTIONVARIABLES may be absent or empty if the call to SMARTFORREDUCE 
%   does not involve any reduction variables. REDUCTIONVARIABLES may
%   have one of two forms.  The canonical form is a 2-element cell array,
%   in which the first element is a function handle REDUCTFUN of the form,
%   VAL = REDUCTFUN(VAL,UPDATE), and REDUCTFUN is commutative and 
%   associative, and the second element is an initial value for the 
%   reduction variable (eg, VAL), so that the first invocation of
%   REDUCTFUN will have initialized operands.  The second form is a 
%   keyword string, which can take the values 'argmin' or 'argmax'.  
%   If the keyword form is specified, SMARTFORREDUCE will supply the
%   appropriate REDUCTFUN and initial value.  If REDUCTIONVARIABLES is 
%   present, and not empty, the function LOOPBODY must supply the 
%   reduction variable value calculated on each invocation as the last,
%   or rightmost, of its return arguments.  If the keyword 'argmin' or
%   'argmax' is specified the SMARTFORREDUCE, the reduction variable value
%   must be a cell array, and the first element of the cell array 
%   must be a numeric value that can be supplied as an operand to
%   MIN or MAX, respectively.
%
%   The function LOOPBODY must support the calling signature
%   VARARGOUT = LOOPBODY(ITER,S), where ITER is the index of the
%   for-loop or parfor-loop executing within SMARTFORSLICEOUT, 
%   and S is either empty or a RandStream object.
%   If S is empty, it tells LOOPBODY that no user-supplied RANDSTREAM
%   object was specified, in which case, if LOOPBODY needs to generate
%   random numbers, it should use the MATLAB default random stream.
%
%   The contents of the struct RNGSCHEME are:
%   
%       uuid               string       Unique identifier for the RNGscheme 
%       useSubstreams      boolean      If 'true', use a separate Substream 
%                                       for each iterate of the loop
%       streams            cell array   The RandStream object(s) to be used 
%                                       for random number generation during the
%                                       invocation of SMARTFORREDUCE. Can be empty. 
%       valid              boolean      RNGSCHEME is currently valid (T/F)
%       useDefaultStream   boolean      RNGSCHEME uses default RANDSTREAM(s) (T/F)
%       streamsOnPool      boolean      RNGscheme deploys multiple streams 
%                                       on a parallel pool (T/F)
%
%   SMARTFORREDUCE is an internal utility for use by 
%   Statistics Toolbox commands, and is not meant for general purpose use.  
%   External users should not rely on its functionality.
